💬 Sentiment Analysis Chatbot 🤖💖
Welcome to my Sentiment Analysis Chatbot! 🌸✨ It’s like having a chatbot that can understand the mood of your text and give you an instant sentiment report! Is it happy, sad, or somewhere in between? 🥰 Let's find out together!

🎯 What’s This About?
This project uses machine learning to predict the sentiment of a text message. Whether you send a cheerful "Hello!" or a sad "I'm feeling down," the chatbot can figure out if it’s positive, negative, or neutral. 😄💬 It’s a fun and interactive way to get sentiment feedback!

💡 How to Use
Enter any message in the text box (e.g., “I’m feeling happy!” 😊).
Hit Analyze sentiment to see the magic! ✨
The chatbot will predict the sentiment and show you how it feels about your message. 😎

🧠 How It Works
Behind the scenes, we use the Naive Bayes classifier (fancy name, huh?) to classify the text. We preprocess the data using TF-IDF to help the model understand the importance of different words. Then, it predicts whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. 😍

🎉 Have Fun!
This chatbot is super fun to play with, and it’s also a good way to practice machine learning! So go ahead, input some random text, and see if the chatbot can guess the mood! 😎💕
